I declare that the following source code was written by me, or provided
by the instructor for this project. I understand that copying source
code from any other source, providing source code to another student, 
or leaving my code on a public web site constitutes cheating.
I acknowledge that  If I am found in violation of this policy this may result
in a zero grade, a permanent record on file and possibly immediate failure of the class.
 
Reflection (1-2 paragraphs):  I really enjoyed writing this program, but had trouble with getting the table to properly format and forgot to add a seperate css file for a while. 
It was really fun to change everyhting about the program once I got the hang of it buty it wass annoying to keep switching tabs to see the imporvements.
I leanred alot about different commands and how they are used along with how tro seperate different pparts of the css from the parts of the html.

    <h2> Dragons Fire</h2>
    <p> A haiku about my favorite fantasy creatures dragons.</p>
    <p> <i>The dragon rises up,<br> flames shoot from its fearsome maw<br> The world burns fiercely</i></p>

    <h2> My Hobbies</h2>
    <h4> I greatly enjoy reading fantasy novels. Mostly becuase of the dragons in them. I find the unique worlds and magic and abilities really intresting and they can draw me in for hours.</h4>
    <h4> I also enjoy playing soccer, I was on a team from a young age up until highschool. I was always the defender due to my lack of stamina and powewreful kick, I was good at short bursts of speed where it really mattered.</h4>
    <h4> I enjoy videogames as well, the games I play the most are Mario Kart Wii and Destiny 2. Both are very different, I enjoy Mario Kart for the chaotic explosions and the fact I had an natural talent for it. Destiny is liked for similar reasons I enjoy the explosions and power I feel when mowing down groups of aliens.</h4>
